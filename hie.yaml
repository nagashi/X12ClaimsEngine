# hie.yaml - Configuration for Haskell IDE Engine / Haskell Language Server (HLS)
#
# This file tells your IDE (VS Code, Emacs, Vim, etc.) how to understand your project structure.
# It maps source directories to their build components so the language server can provide:
#   - Code completion
#   - Type information on hover
#   - Go-to-definition
#   - Error checking
#   - Refactoring support
#
# Using Stack's cradle to tell HLS which components each path belongs to.

cradle:
  stack:
    - path: "./src"
      component: "claims-x12-dsl:lib"
    - path: "./app/Main.hs"
      component: "claims-x12-dsl:exe:claims-x12-dsl-exe"
    - path: "./test"
      component: "claims-x12-dsl:test:claims-x12-dsl-test"
    - path: "./Setup.hs"
      component: "claims-x12-dsl:lib"
